Hi there, I'm Abdelrahman a Machine Learning Engineer and Professional Data Analyst who loves analyzing data and extracting information from it. I recently worked on a project that analyzes the show for appointments dataset using NumPy arrays and Pandas Series and Data Frame. Visualizations made in the project depict the data in an appropriate manner (i.e., has appropriate labels, scale, legends, and plot type) that allows plots to be readily interpreted. I'd love to combine my passion for learning and teaching with my data analysis skills to continue investigating datasets and extracting useful information from them.

Skills:
• Python
• Scikit-learn
• Numpy
• Pandas
• Matplotlib
• SQL
